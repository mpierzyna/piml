# Pi-ML: A dimensional analysis-based machine learning framework for physical modeling


## Reference
Pierzyna, M., Saathof, R., and Basu, S. "Î -ML: A dimensional analysis-based machine learning parameterization of 
optical turbulence in the atmospheric surface layer". _Optics Letters_. 2023. pp. ???-???.

## Setup
1.  Clone or download this git repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/mpierzyna/piml
    ```
2.  Set up the required Python packages in a new conda environment:
    ```shell
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
    **Note**: The exact package versions from the environment file have to be used to guarantee that trained
    models can be loaded later.
3. Set up 

## Example: Optical turbulence in the atmospheric surface layer
An example workspace set up to model optical turbulence strength $C_n^2$ following Pierzyna et al. (2023) is given 
in [workspace/cn2_mlo](workspace/cn2_mlo).
